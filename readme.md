# Open Converters

Converting from one thing to another is a solved problem. In most cases an extension method suffices quite nicely. However, as a solution increases in complexity, I find myself wanting to implement an injection/discovery mechanism based on capabilities. I prefer the `try with out parameter that returns a bool of success` paradigm.  This is an opinionated suggestion for doing that.
